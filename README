This package allows basic mapping from shapefile data from OpenStreetMaps or Mapzen.

Other data can be transformed and overlayed on the map for analysis.

Map views are plotting from shapefiles which can be very large, but this forgoes the need for tiles, tileservers, or any kind of precompilation
